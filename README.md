# Hi there! Pasang here 👽

I'm a cloud engineer based in London, UK, passionate about building applications in FinTech and Machine Learning.

While I enjoy the challenge of taking things apart (figuratively!), I find immense satisfaction in creating something new from scratch.

Skills: Python, AWS, GCP, Docker, Kubernetes

## 👨🏽‍💻 Projects

**Foodie**

This project will leverage AI in an application and allow users to scan their fridge and ask for recommendations on what to cook for the night! I am always stuck on what to make for meals, especially when random bits are in my fridge.
A great way to reduce waste and also utilise ingredients that sit in your pantry for far too long 🚫

**Other Projects**

I have various other random repositories where I am learning to use a tool or experimenting!
